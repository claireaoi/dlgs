# Deep learning in Games and Simulation course -- ITU fall 2023

### Labs 

I'm running python 3.9.7.
The python packages we'll be using can be found in `../requirements.txt`.
I recommend making a virtual enviornment called `dlgs`, activating it (source <path_to_dlgs>/bin/activate 
), and then running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
The `requirements.txt` file, along with the rest of the repo, will be updated throughout the course.
